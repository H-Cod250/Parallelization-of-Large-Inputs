# Parallelism of Employee Working Hours Management System
Parallelizing a simple employee management program by analysing employee working hours over a week, calculating the total hours worked each day and identifying the day with the highest and lowest total working hours. The code includes both sequential and parallelized implementations, enabling performance comparisons on large datasets.


# Features

    Employee Data Generation: Dynamically generates a specified number of employee names and assigns random working hours for each day of the week.

    Day-wise Analysis: Calculates the total working hours for each day to identify:
        The day with the maximum total working hours.
        The day with the minimum total working hours.

    Employee-specific Weekly Summary:
        Allows detailed analysis of an individual employeeâ€™s weekly hours.
        Displays the day with the highest working hours for the selected employee.
        Calculates weekly salary based on predefined rates, factoring in potential overtime.

    Parallelization Methods: The code provides both sequential and parallel versions to benchmark performance, especially on large datasets.
