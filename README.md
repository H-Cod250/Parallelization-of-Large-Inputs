# Parallelism of Employee Working Hours Management System
Parallelizing a simple employee management program by analysing employee working hours over a week, calculating the total hours worked each day and identifying the day with the highest and lowest total working hours. The code includes both sequential and parallelized implementations, enabling performance comparisons on large datasets.
